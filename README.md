# The Quick Bite

The Quick Bite is an application created for indecisive people that can’t choose where to eat next. With our app, users can provide their city, click on a particular cuisine icon that suits their current food-mood, and are presented with a list of options in the area with quick and helpful information about each.

AS A foodie looking for something to eat in the area </br>
I WANT to easily find a list of restaurants with food I’m craving </br>
SO THAT I CAN make a quick decision on my next meal.

The restaurant and city data was generated using the Zomato API. Whenever the use refreshes the screen or loads the app in their browser for the first time, a random image is retrieved using Pixabay API to give the user suggestions regarding what they may be in the mood for or simply provide an enhanced aesthetic experience for the user.
