# The Quick Bite

The Quick Bite is an application created for indecisive people that can’t choose where to eat next. With our app, users can provide their city, click on a particular cuisine icon that suits their current food-mood, and are presented with a list of options in the area with quick and helpful information about each.

AS A foodie looking for something to eat in the area </br>
I WANT to easily find a list of restaurants with food I’m craving </br>
SO THAT I CAN make a quick decision on my next meal.
